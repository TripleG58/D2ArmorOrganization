# philosophy

## artifice (preface)

factor artifice in before applying this philosophy

i.e.) 10 res, 20 rec, 20 disc + artifice satisfies 23 disc requirement (22.5 b/c class item mw +2)

_could_ use 22 minimum with at least _one_ artifice slot dedicated to disc, then, could let one slip to 21

lots of other artifice combos, but you can see how they need to be factored in to base stats _before_ referencing this philosophy

the +/- 15 artifice bonus (with all 5 pieces) won't allow for any armor pieces to satisfy multiple requirements here that I'm aware, but I didn't do all the math involved in making that determination

quickly, I suppose it could allow a 23 disc / 7 str armor piece to satisfy both disc & str spike set requirements b/c 7 + 15 = 22 which is saved by class item mw +2, but _all_ the other armor in the set would have to be PERFECT, so I believe, for the sake of one's sanity, that the artifice mod is best used for combatting RNG and only one piece of armor should be used to satisfy the stat requirements of the armor organization philosophy

## raid armor

armor without stat requirements (raid sets & iron banner sets) can satisfy stat requirements also

i.e.) last wish helmet with 30 rec, 23 disc satisfies stat requirement & raid set requirement

TODO: create loadouts for each class for each raid & determine max amount of armor necessary (factor in min/max for master raids)  
VoG) only 2 pieces needed for VoG (oracle precision dmg multiplier)  
KF) never used any of these mods  
LW) taken barrier, armaments, etc.  
GoS) how many relay defenders ideal for GoS? Feels like this raid should be vaulted  
DSC) herd thinner nice to have, other mods meh, but maybe metah if reworked/master added?  
Vow) master VoW, how many grenade regen mods did I use for healing nades? How many pervading darkness dmg buffs needed?  
RoN) look into doing this on master. Do raid mods help?

## pvp

pretty much just want one iron banner set for each character for extra prisms

_maybe_ look at int set for trials?

## warlock

10 res & 20 rec on everything allows 90 rec and 50 res w/mw

disc spike set = default

23 + 2 = 25

25 * 4 = 100

adjust stat mods to counter fragment offsets

str spike set required for melee builds (winter's guile exists), but not as important as disc set since it's niche

## titan

similar to warlock philosophy, although, str set may be more/less important due to build variety offerred by class

## hunter

str set not necessary at all b/c gambler's dodge used to refund melee in every melee build I know of. Always other auto-loading options than marksmen & in DPS (where marksmen used), no one cares about melees on this class

therefore, optimize for disc

23 disc w/extreme 30 spike in each mob, rec, res 

30 * 2 + 10 = 70

allows mix & match of double 70s in two base stats of upper trinity supplementing w/mods

# categories

IDEA: maybe keep two high-res pieces (one str, one disc) to offset fragment penalties? Can be any of the 4 stat pieces, so decent RNG. (rec for titan)
